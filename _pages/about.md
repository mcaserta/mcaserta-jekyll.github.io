![A picture of Mirko](/images/mirko.jpg)

I'm a software engineer based in Rome, Italy. I primarily dabble in enterprise
java backends, although I'm not religious about programming languages,
frameworks, platforms and architectures as I like to live on the bleeding edge
and basically be a curious nerd about practically too many fields in human
knowledge.

I also have a past as an amateur jazz musician that might creep out from time
to time in my posts here.
