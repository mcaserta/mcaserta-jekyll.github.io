I'm a software engineer based in Rome, Italy. I primarily work on enterprise
java backends, although I'm not religious about programming languages,
frameworks, platforms and architectures as I like to live on the bleeding edge
and basically be a curious nerd about practically almost all of the fields of
human knowledge.

I also have a past as an amateur jazz musician that might creep out from time
to time in my posts here.
